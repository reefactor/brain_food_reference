# Startup Playbook

### Leap of faith

> Starting a startup has been "figured out". Its not a frontier anymore, there's already a playbook for that Any Capital and Advice is commoditized over time.
> The only advantage/moat is a network effect  
> -- Sam Altman

> You've got to jump off the cliff and build your wings on the way down  
> ― Ray Bradbury

> Starting a company is like throwing yourself off the cliff and assembling an airplane on the way down  
> -- Reid Hoffman (paraphrasing Ray Bradbury and Kierkegaard's [leap of faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_of_faith))

> Impossible is just a big word thrown around by small men who find it easier to live in the world they’ve been given than to explore the power they have to change it. Impossible is not a fact. It’s an opinion. Impossible is not a declaration. It’s a dare. Impossible is potential. Impossible is temporary. Impossible is nothing  
> -- Muhammed Ali

> The basic principles and concepts supporting The Magic of Thinking Big come from the highest-pedigree sources, the very biggest-thinking minds yet to live on planet Earth. Minds  like the prophet David, who wrote, _"For as one thinketh in his heart, so is he"_; minds such as Emerson, who said, _"Great men are those who see that thoughts rule the world"_; minds like Milton, who in Paradise Lost wrote, _"The mind is its own place and in itself can make a heaven of hell or a hell of heaven."_ Amazingly perceptive minds like Shakespeare, who observed, _"There is nothing either good or bad except that thinking makes it so"_. 
-- David J Schwartz, The Magic of Thinking Big

Why start a startup? Because early design decisions have the greatest impact.



### Success Formula

ProbabilityOfSuccess = idea * execution * timing * luck

Do the work to **make sure you are building a product that people will actually find valuable**. 


### Team

> First 150 people form a dna of a company culture  

> Talent is the best asset class  
> -- Graham Duncan at [Tim Ferris podcast](https://tim.blog/2019/03/01/the-tim-ferriss-show-transcripts-graham-duncan-362/)

> Hiring wrong people is often the N1 mistake. That competes with the mistake of putting customer, product and business validation last  
> -- Sasha Galitsky, Almaz Capital Partner

> Easy startups are easy to start but hard to make successful.  The most precious commodity in the startup ecosystem right now is talented people, and for the most part talented people want to work on something they find meaningful.
A startup eventually has to get a lot of people to join its quest.  It's usually reasonably easy to get the first five or ten people to join—you can offer large equity grants and areas of responsibility.  But eventually, what you have to recruit with are the mission of the company, the likelihood of massive success, and the quality of the people there  
> ... There is a derivative of the Peter Principle at play here—your startup will rise to the level where it can no longer attract enough talented people.  (This sometimes holds true for careers too—the limiting factor for many careers eventually becomes how many talented people you know and can get to work with you.)

#### Trust

> Without trust, communication breaks. More specifically:  
> **In any human interaction, the required amount of communication is inversely proportional to the level of trust**.  
> Consider the following: If I trust you completely, then I require no explanation or communication of your actions whatsoever, because I know that whatever you are doing is in my best interests. On the other hand, if I don’t trust you at all, then no amount of talking, explaining, or reasoning will have any effect on me, because I do not trust that you are telling me the truth. In a company context, this is a critical point. As a company grows, communication becomes its biggest challenge. If the employees fundamentally trust the CEO, then communication will be vastly more efficient than if they don’t. Telling things as they are is a critical part of building this trust. A CEO’s ability to build this trust over time is often the difference between companies that execute well and companies that are chaotic.  
> -- Ben Horowitz, The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers

Assess credibility => give decision space. Credibility = proven competence + relationships + integrity.

#### Communication overhead

Underestimated power in keeping team small: small team cohesion and low communication overhead.

#### Principal-Agent Problem
> To me, the principal-agent problem is the single most fundamental problem in microeconomics. If you do not understand the principal-agent problem, you will not know how to navigate your way through the world. It is important if you want to build a successful company or be successful in your dealings.  
It’s a very simple concept. Julius Caesar famously said, “If you want it done, then go. And if not, then send.” What he meant was, if you want it done right, then you have to go yourself and do it. When you are the principal, then you are the owner—you care, and you will do a great job. When you are the agent and you are doing it on somebody else’s behalf, you can do a bad job. You just don’t care. You optimize for yourself rather than for the principal’s assets.  
The smaller the company, the more everyone feels like a principal. The less you feel like an agent, the better the job you’re going to do. The more closely you can tie someone’s compensation to the exact value they’re creating, the more you turn them into a principal, and the less you turn them into an agent.

Break/Fix loops - become antifragile, otherwise - become rigid risk averse
