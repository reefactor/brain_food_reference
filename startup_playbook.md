# Startup Playbook

> Starting a startup has been "figured out". Its not a frontier anymore, there's already a playbook for that Any Capital and Advice is commoditized over time.

> ― Ray Bradbury

> Easy startups are easy to start but hard to make successful.  The most precious commodity in the startup ecosystem right now is talented people, and for the most part talented people want to work on something they find meaningful.
A startup eventually has to get a lot of people to join its quest.  It's usually reasonably easy to get the first five or ten people to join—you can offer large equity grants and areas of responsibility.  But eventually, what you have to recruit with are the mission of the company, the likelihood of massive success, and the quality of the people there  
> ... There is a derivative of the Peter Principle at play here—your startup will rise to the level where it can no longer attract enough talented people.  (This sometimes holds true for careers too—the limiting factor for many careers eventually becomes how many talented people you know and can get to work with you.)

Why start a startup? Because early design decisions have the greatest impact.

Find Deep experts in the domain space but willing to embrace change.

Hire for strenghts, not for weeknesses, [hire people who are smarter than you](/hire_people_smarter_than_you.md).

Assess credibility => give decision space. Credibility = proven competence + relationships + integrity.
