> You are what you eat

> Nowadays the problem is not information access but [information overload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_overload). The real value produced by an information provider comes in locating, filtering, and communicating what is useful  
> ― Carl Shapiro, Information Rules: A Strategic Guide to the Network 1998

> What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention, and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it

### Gems of wisdom

> [Nanos gigantum humeris insidentes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants)

> I believe in the discipline of mastering the best that other people have ever figured out. I don't believe in just sitting down and trying to dream it all up yourself. Nobody's that smart  
> -- Charles Munger

> In my whole life, I have known no wise people (over a broad subject matter area) who didn't read all the time-none, zero  
> -- Charles Munger

### Mental models

>  ..all models are approximations. Essentially, [all models are wrong, but some are useful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong).  
> However, the approximate nature of the model must always be borne in mind..  
> -- George E. P. Box

> You’ve got to have models in your head. And you’ve got to array your experience ‑ both vicarious and direct ‑ on this latticework of models. You may have noticed students who just try to remember and pound back what is remembered. Well, they fail in school and in life. You’ve got to hang experience on a latticework of models in your head  
> -- Charlie Munger

> [A map is not the territory it represents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation), but, if correct, it has a similar structure to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness  
> —  Alfred Korzybski, Science and Sanity


[Mental models](https://fs.blog/mental-models/) help us perceive and navigate the _physical_ world with [sensory inputs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception#Types_of_perception)
as well as our inner _mental realm_.

The world is huge and our sensory bandwidth is tiny and memory capacity is limited.

So Models simplify huge complexity of the world
into [perception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_cortex)
and [reasoning patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_process_theory#System_2_in_humans).

This idea is similar to the statistical machine learning approach i.e. modern deep learning
where the [Learning Algorithm is compressing the world into hierarchies of abstractions](https://www.skynettoday.com/editorials/nooscope#the-learning-algorithm-compressing-the-world-into-a-statistical-model)

Shared Mental Models distill knowledge into the collective wisdom according to [DIKW pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_pyramid#Computational_representation) (which itself is a model too).

People have tried to label them to build taxonomies of most common models
in order to create reasoning frameworks and to put them in toolboxes.

And so there're [plenty of them online](https://www.google.com/search?q=mental+models)

#### Gradient ascent along steep learning curve
> You learn the most when you feel like you're the most stupid person in the room

> To attain knowledge, add things everyday. To attain wisdom, remove things everyday  
> -- Lao Zi

> Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years.  
> ― Bill Gates

> Warren and I are very good at destroying our own best-loved ideas. Any year that you don't destroy one of your best-loved ideas is probably a wasted year. Charlie likes the analogy of looking at one's ideas and approaches as "tools." When a better tool (idea or approach) comes along, what could be better than to swap it for your old, less useful tool? 'Warren and I routinely do this, but most people, as Galbraith says, forever cling to their old, less useful tools.
> -- Poor Charlie's Almanack

> Relentlessly prune bullshit, don't wait to do things that matter, and savor the time you have. That's what you do when [life is short](http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html).
> -- Paul Graham

Accumulated [knowledge asymmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_asymmetry) yelds Power.


#### Multidisciplinary skills
> And the models have to come from multiple disciplines—because all the wisdom of the world is not to be found in one little academic department. That’s why poetry professors, by and large, are so unwise in a worldly sense. They don’t have enough models in their heads. So you’ve got to have models across a fair array of disciplines
> -- Charlie Munger / [A Lesson on Elementary Worldly Wisdom](https://fs.blog/great-talks/a-lesson-on-worldly-wisdom/)

> To the man with only a hammer, every problem looks like a nail

####  Reasoning
> In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. But, in practice, there is  
> -- Jan L.A. van de Snepscheut

> We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.  
> -- Aristotle

> Our character, basically, is a composite of our habits. “Sow a thought, reap an action; sow an action, reap a habit; sow a habit, reap a character; sow a character, reap a destiny,” the maxim goes  
> ― Stephen R. Covey, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People

Expertise requires going from unconscious incompetence to conscious incompetence to conscious competence and finally to unconscious competence.




##### Strategy
> Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth  
> -- Mike Tyson

> Plans are worthless, but planning is everything. There is a very great distinction because when you are planning for an emergency you must start with this one thing: the very definition of "emergency" is that it is unexpected, therefore it is not going to happen the way you are planning.
> — Dwight D. Eisenhower

##### Tactics
> The abstract summary of your actions is your strategy; what you'll do to implement the strategy is your tactics. Frequently, a strategy at one managerial level is the tactical concern of the next higher level.
> — Andy Grove (High Output Management)

> Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat.
> — Sun Tzu


##### Routine

> Nulla dies sine linea

> True greatness consists of being great in little things. 
> -- Charles Simmons

> How you do anything is how you do everything
> -- T. Harv Eker / Secrets of the Millionaire Mind book

> Humans are basically habit machines… I think learning how to break habits is actually a very important meta skill and can serve you in life almost better than anything else
> -- Naval Ravikant

> Inspiration is for amateurs while the rest of us just show up and get to work  
> -- Chuck Close

###### Morning ritual
> End your day thinking about an important question MIQ and then wake up the next morning (pre-input, before checking your phone or any news) and brainstorm on it  
> -- Josh Waitzkin

### Pointers of Truth

> The wisdom of the wise, and the experience of ages, may be preserved by quotations  
> ― Isaac Disraeli

> It is a good thing for an uneducated man to read books of quotations  
> ― Sir Winston Churchill

> The greatest thing in this world is not so much where we are, but in what direction we are moving.  
> ― Oliver Wendell Holmes

> Я всю жизнь выписывал пословицы, которые мне нравились своей глубиной и точностью. Причем, не просто выписывал, а искал и находил решение трудных проблем. Когда появлялись дети, и я им вместо пустых назиданий давал эти пословицы.
Очень часто сила, свет этих народных указаний выручала меня, подбадривала, наставляла, утешала.  
> ― Александр Солженицын

Comming soon ..


### Limitations of language
> When the sage points at the moon, the fool looks at the finger
>> Truth has nothing to do with language. Truth is like Moon in the sky and language is like the finger that points to the moon. A finger can point out where the moon is, but the finger is not the truth. You can see the moon without help of any fingers, can you?

> -- Chan Buddhist scripture [Platform Sutra](https://www.quora.com/Does-the-saying-When-the-sage-points-at-the-moon-the-fool-looks-at-the-finger-really-have-Chinese-origins)
