### Gems of wisdom

> [Nanos gigantum humeris insidentes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants)

> I believe in the discipline of mastering the best that other people have ever figured out. I don't believe in just sitting down and trying to dream it all up yourself. Nobody's that smart  
> -- Charles Munger

> In my whole life, I have known no wise people (over a broad subject matter area) who didn't read all the time-none, zero  
> -- Charles Munger

> Repetitio est mater studiorum. Any kind of important book should immediately be read twice, partly because one grasps the latter in its entirety the second time, and only really understands the beginning when the end is known; and partly because in reading it the second time one’s temper and mood are different, so that one gets another impression; it may be that one sees the matter in another light  
> -- Arthur Schopenhauer on reading books.

> Fools say that they learn by experience. I prefer to profit by others experience.  
> ― Otto von Bismarck

### Mental models

>  ..all models are approximations. Essentially, [all models are wrong, but some are useful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong).  
> However, the approximate nature of the model must always be borne in mind..  
> -- George E. P. Box

> You’ve got to have models in your head. And you’ve got to array your experience ‑ both vicarious and direct ‑ on this latticework of models. You may have noticed students who just try to remember and pound back what is remembered. Well, they fail in school and in life. You’ve got to hang experience on a latticework of models in your head  
> -- Charlie Munger

> [A map is not the territory it represents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation), but, if correct, it has a similar structure to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness  
> —  Alfred Korzybski, Science and Sanity


[Mental models](https://fs.blog/mental-models/) help us perceive and navigate the _physical_ world with [sensory inputs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception#Types_of_perception)
as well as our inner _mental realm_.

The world is huge and our sensory bandwidth is tiny and memory capacity is limited.

So Models simplify huge complexity of the world
into [perception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_cortex)
and [reasoning patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_process_theory#System_2_in_humans).

This idea is similar to the statistical machine learning approach i.e. modern deep learning
where the [Learning Algorithm is compressing the world into hierarchies of abstractions](https://www.skynettoday.com/editorials/nooscope#the-learning-algorithm-compressing-the-world-into-a-statistical-model)

Shared Mental Models distill knowledge into the collective wisdom according to [DIKW pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_pyramid#Computational_representation) (which itself is a model too).

People have tried to label them to build taxonomies of most common models
in order to create reasoning frameworks and to put them in toolboxes.

And so there're [plenty of them online](https://www.google.com/search?q=mental+models)

#### Gradient ascent along steep learning curve

> To attain knowledge, add things everyday. To attain wisdom, remove things everyday  
> -- Lao Zi

> Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years.  
> ― Bill Gates

> Warren and I are very good at destroying our own best-loved ideas. Any year that you don't destroy one of your best-loved ideas is probably a wasted year. Charlie likes the analogy of looking at one's ideas and approaches as "tools." When a better tool (idea or approach) comes along, what could be better than to swap it for your old, less useful tool? 'Warren and I routinely do this, but most people, as Galbraith says, forever cling to their old, less useful tools.
> -- Poor Charlie's Almanack

> The second half of a man's life is made up of nothing but the habits he has acquired during the first half
> ― Demons novel by Fyodor Dostoevsky

> Relentlessly prune bullshit, don't wait to do things that matter, and savor the time you have. That's what you do when [life is short](http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html).
> -- Paul Graham


Iterate and refine models to sharp your [decision making skills](#decisions) 

Make continuous incremental improvements - [Kaizen (改善)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen))

Accumulated [knowledge asymmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_asymmetry) yelds Power.


#### Multidisciplinary skills
> And the models have to come from multiple disciplines—because all the wisdom of the world is not to be found in one little academic department. That’s why poetry professors, by and large, are so unwise in a worldly sense. They don’t have enough models in their heads. So you’ve got to have models across a fair array of disciplines
> -- Charlie Munger / [A Lesson on Elementary Worldly Wisdom](https://fs.blog/great-talks/a-lesson-on-worldly-wisdom/)

> To the man with only a hammer, every problem looks like a nail

> There's multiple ways to succeed in life: 1) get to top 1% at 1 skill  2) combine top 10% of multiple skills 3) learn art of storytelling - powerful way to rule the world  
> -- Tim Ferriss podcast

> It’s kind of fun to sit there and outthink people who are way smarter than you are because you’ve trained yourself to be more objective and more multidisciplinary. Furthermore, there is a lot of money in it, as I can testify from my own personal experience  
> – Charlie Munger

> Interdisciplinary research is hard.. Say you get two world-leading experts, in maths and genomics – there obviously could be some crossover. But who is going to do the work to understand the other person's field, their jargon, what their real problem is? .. Some of the most interesting areas of science are in the gaps between, the confluences between subjects. What I've tried to do in building DeepMind is to find 'glue people', those who are world class in multiple domains, who possess the creativity to find analogies and points of contact between different subjects. Generally speaking, when that happens, the magic happens  
> -- [Demis Hassabis on hiring at Deepmind ](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/deepmind-protein-folding)

> An expert knows more and more about less and less until he or she knows everything about nothing.  
> A generalist knows less and less about more and more until he or she knows nothing about everything.  
> -- [attributed to various sources](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/10/25/more/)

> A fox knows many things, but a hedgehog one important thing  
> -- [greek poet Archilochus quoted by Isaiah Berlin to define a spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hedgehog_and_the_Fox)

Move from I-shaped to T-shaped to Pi-Shaped to M-shaped individual yet be aware of [Jack of all trades, master of none](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_of_all_trades,_master_of_none). The key here ballance factors:
* [The Pareto Principle in Learning – The 80:20 Rule](https://www.briantracy.com/blog/personal-success/how-to-use-the-80-20-rule-pareto-principle/) says that learning process isn't linear - you achieve 80% of result in the begining with only 20% of time. 
* [Speed of Obsolescence of Knowledge and Skills](http://career.iresearchnet.com/career-development/obsolescence-of-knowledge-and-skills/) at some point on a learning curve become greater than speed of your learning so the latter 20% isn't worth it
* M-shaped skills strategy gives exponential drop in competition among crossover experts with growth of M (Venn diagram of the overlap of M domains is exponentially small)
* Skewed Pareto distributions come from a Normal Distribution + Power of Accumulative Advantage over time.
Small differences multiplied by consistent performance accumulate disproportionate rewards over time.
So, in highly competitive zero-sum game, the Winner-Takes-All in ~rat race~[Red Queen's race](https://fs.blog/2012/10/the-red-queen-effect/)

[Crossover experts](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/deepmind-protein-folding) are Pi-shaped speciallists.

Single crossdomain B+ speciallist is better than 2 A+ with gap between domains because of the communication overhead.



####  Reasoning
> In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. But, in practice, there is  
> -- Jan L.A. van de Snepscheut

> We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.  
> -- Aristotle

> [Deliberate practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_%28learning_method%29#Deliberate_practice) makes perfect

> Your beliefs become your thoughts, Your thoughts become your words, Your words become your actions, Your actions become your habits, Your habits become your values, Your values become your destiny  
> — Mahatma Gandhi

> Our character, basically, is a composite of our habits. “Sow a thought, reap an action; sow an action, reap a habit; sow a habit, reap a character; sow a character, reap a destiny,” the maxim goes  
> ― Stephen R. Covey, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People

> There are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns—the ones we don't know we don't know

##### Values

> You've got to serve somebody - Bob Dylan

> Principles are like lighthouses. They are natural laws that cannot be broken  
> ― Stephen R. Covey, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People

> Values are most important, abilities come next, and skills are the least important. Yet most people make the mistake of choosing skills and abilities first and overlooking values. It is important for you to know what mix of qualities is important to ﬁt each role and, more broadly, what values and abilities are required in people with whom you can have successful relationships. In picking people for long-term relationships  
> -- Ray Dalio

> Of course if we make good things, it is not only to the credit of science; it is also to the credit of the moral choice which led us to good work. Scientific knowledge is an enabling power to do either good or bad — but it does not carry instructions on how to use it. Such power has evident value — even though the power may be negated by what one does with it.
>  To every man is given the key to the gates of heaven; the same key opens the gates of hell.
(Proverb of the Buddhist religion)
> What then, is the value of the key to heaven? It is true that if we lack clear instructions that enable us to determine which is the gate to heaven and which the gate to hell, the key may be a dangerous object to use. But the key obviously has value: how can we enter heaven without it?  
> -- Richard Feynman on [value of science and moral choice](https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/07/19/richard-feynman-science-morality-poem/)

> If you can figure your life so that what you're genually doing is aiming to the highest possible good then the things that you need to survive and to thrive on a daily base will deliver themselves to you...
> If you dare to do the most difficult thing that you can conceptualize your life will work out better that it will if you do anything else. Well how do you find out if that's true, its a Kierkegaardian's Leap of Faith, there's no way to find out unless you do it, so no one can tell you either because if it works for some else, that's no proof that it;ll work for you. You have to be all-in in this game...
> If you manifest yourself properly in the world that those things will come your way."
> I've watched people operate in the world and I would say that There's no more effective way of operating than to conceptualize the highest good that you can and strive to attain it. There's no more practical way to a kind of success you would new if you only knew what success is"
> -- Jordan B Peterson [Biblical Series VII](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gFjB9FTN58&index=7&list=PL22J3VaeABQD_IZs7y60I3lUrrFTzkpat)

> Life is suffering and if you say it meaningless then your suffering is meaningless dumb and reckless. Find higher purpose and goal to suffer  
> -- Jordan B Peterson

> Nature loves courage. You make the commitment and nature will respond to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles. Dream the impossible dream and the world will not grind you under, it will lift you up. This is the trick. This is what all these teachers and philosophers who really counted, who really touched the alchemical gold, this is what they understood. This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall. This is how magic is done. By hurling yourself into the abyss and discovering it’s a feather bed

##### Strategy
> Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth  
> -- Mike Tyson

> Plans are worthless, but planning is everything. There is a very great distinction because when you are planning for an emergency you must start with this one thing: the very definition of "emergency" is that it is unexpected, therefore it is not going to happen the way you are planning.
> — Dwight D. Eisenhower

##### Tactics
> The abstract summary of your actions is your strategy; what you'll do to implement the strategy is your tactics. Frequently, a strategy at one managerial level is the tactical concern of the next higher level.
> — Andy Grove (High Output Management)

> Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat.
> — Sun Tzu


##### Routine

> Nulla dies sine linea

> True greatness consists of being great in little things. 
> -- Charles Simmons

> How you do anything is how you do everything
> -- T. Harv Eker / Secrets of the Millionaire Mind book

> Inspiration is for amateurs while the rest of us just show up and get to work  
> -- Chuck Close

Amateurs have a goal. [Professionals have a process](https://fs.blog/2017/06/habits-vs-goals/).

###### Habbits

> First we make our habits, then our habits make us  
> — Charles C. Nobel

> Humans are basically habit machines… I think learning how to break habits is actually a very important meta skill and can serve you in life almost better than anything else
> -- Naval Ravikant

> Habit is the intersection of knowledge (what to do), skill (how to do), and desire (want to do)

##### Decisions

> The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function.
One should, for example, be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise. This philosophy fitted on to my early adult life, when I saw the improbable, the implausible, often the "impossible," come true.”  
> ― F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Crack-Up

###### Uncertainty

> We have two classes of forecasters:  Those who don’t know – and those who don’t know they don’t know  
> -- John Kenneth Galbraith

> Forecasts usually tell us more of the forecaster than of the future  
> -- Warren Buffett

> Those who have knowledge don’t predict; those who predict don’t have knowledge.  
> -- Lao Tzu

> There are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns—the ones we don't know we don't know  
> -- Rumsfeld [DoD speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns)

> Beyond these three categories there is a fourth, the unknown known, that which we intentionally refuse to acknowledge that we know  
> -- attributed to Slavoj Žižek

> People can foresee the future only when it coincides with their own wishes, and the most grossly obvious facts can be ignored when they are unwelcome  
> -- George Orwell

> The field of economics is muddled and imprecise, and there’s good reason it’s called “the dismal science.” Unlike a "real" science like physics, in economics there are no rules that one can count on to consistently produce a given outcome, as in “if a, then b.” There are only patterns that tend to repeat, and while they may be historical, logical and often-observed, they’re still only tendencies.  
> -- Howard Marks ["Uncertainty" memo](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/uncertainty.pdf)

> .. a lot of that extrapolation – and just about all the rest of our conclusions – consists of what Lipsitch calls opinion or speculation and what I call guesswork. (George Bernard Shaw said, “All professions are conspiracies against the laity.” Thus the rules of the investment profession seem to require that its members describe their views about the future using highsounding terms like “analysis,” “assessment,” “projection,” “prediction” and “forecast.” Rarely do we see the word “guess.”)  
> -- Howard Marks Memo: [Knowledge Of The Future](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/knowledge-of-the-future.pdf)

_**Known knowns**_ refer to a high level of confidence, yet [overconfidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overconfidence_effect) is _the most significant of the cognitive biases_.

> It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so  
> -- Mark Twain, but also to several others:

People with low ability at a task [overestimate their ability (Dunning–Kruger effect
)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) at the same time high-achievers suffer from opposite cognitive bias - [underestimate themselves (impostor syndrome)
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)


_**Known unknowns**_ refer to considered "risks" under [estimated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment) uncertainty so it can be [managed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management)

Life is a game with [incomplete and imperfect information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_information#Complete_versus_perfect_information), so people have developed frameworks to estimate confidence when [managing decisions under uncertainty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management).


_**Unknown unknowns**_ refer to risks invisible, unconsidered and unestimated e.g. [Black Swans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory)

> … Black Swans hijack our brains, making us feel we “sort of” or “almost” predicted them, because they are retrospectively explainable. We don’t realize the role of these Swans in life because of this illusion of predictability. Life is more, a lot more, labyrinthine than shown in our memory— our minds are in the business of turning history into something smooth and linear, which makes us underestimate randomness. But when we see it, we fear it and overreact. Because of this fear and thirst for order, some human systems, by disrupting the invisible or not so visible logic of things, tend to be exposed to harm from Black Swans and almost never get any benefit. You get pseudo-order when you seek order; you only get a measure of order and control when you embrace randomness.

> By grasping the mechanisms of antifragility we can build a systematic and broad guide to **nonpredictive decision making under uncertainty** in business, politics, medicine, and life in general— anywhere the unknown preponderates, any situation in which there is randomness, unpredictability, opacity, or incomplete understanding of things..

> It is far easier to figure out if something is fragile than to predict the occurrence of an event that may harm it. Fragility can be measured; risk is not measurable (outside of casinos or the minds of people who call themselves “risk experts”). This provides a solution to what I’ve called the Black Swan problem— the impossibility of calculating the risks of consequential rare events and predicting their occurrence. Sensitivity to harm from volatility is tractable, more so than forecasting the event that would cause the harm. So we propose to stand our current approaches to prediction, prognostication, and risk management on their heads.

> .. we can almost always detect antifragility (and fragility) using a simple test of asymmetry : **anything that has more upside than downside from random events (or certain shocks) is antifragile; the reverse is fragile**  
> --  Nassim Taleb in Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder

Antifragility is the antidote to [Black Swans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory).


_**Unknown knowns**_ refer to cognitive bias of self-denial to accept new facts - [evidence that challenges prior belief system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem)


### Pointers of Truth

> The wisdom of the wise, and the experience of ages, may be preserved by quotations  
> ― Isaac Disraeli

> It is a good thing for an uneducated man to read books of quotations  
> ― Sir Winston Churchill

> The greatest thing in this world is not so much where we are, but in what direction we are moving.  
> ― Oliver Wendell Holmes

> Я всю жизнь выписывал пословицы, которые мне нравились своей глубиной и точностью. Причем, не просто выписывал, а искал и находил решение трудных проблем. Когда появлялись дети, и я им вместо пустых назиданий давал эти пословицы.
Очень часто сила, свет этих народных указаний выручала меня, подбадривала, наставляла, утешала.  
> ― Александр Солженицын



### Limitations of language
> When the sage points at the moon, the fool looks at the finger
>> Truth has nothing to do with language. Truth is like Moon in the sky and language is like the finger that points to the moon. A finger can point out where the moon is, but the finger is not the truth. You can see the moon without help of any fingers, can you?

> -- Chan Buddhist scripture [Platform Sutra](https://www.quora.com/Does-the-saying-When-the-sage-points-at-the-moon-the-fool-looks-at-the-finger-really-have-Chinese-origins)
