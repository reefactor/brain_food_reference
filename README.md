### Gems of wisdom

> [Nanos gigantum humeris insidentes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants)

> I believe in the discipline of mastering the best that other people have ever figured out. I don't believe in just sitting down and trying to dream it all up yourself. Nobody's that smart  
> -- Charles Munger

> In my whole life, I have known no wise people (over a broad subject matter area) who didn't read all the time-none, zero

### Mental models

>  ..all models are approximations. Essentially, [all models are wrong, but some are useful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong).  
> However, the approximate nature of the model must always be borne in mind..  
> -- George E. P. Box

> You’ve got to have models in your head. And you’ve got to array your experience ‑ both vicarious and direct ‑ on this latticework of models. You may have noticed students who just try to remember and pound back what is remembered. Well, they fail in school and in life. You’ve got to hang experience on a latticework of models in your head  
> -- Charlie Munger

[Mental models](https://fs.blog/mental-models/) help us perceive and navigate the _physical_ world with [sensory inputs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception#Types_of_perception)
as well as our inner _mental realm_.

The world is huge and our sensory bandwidth is tiny and memory capacity is limited.

So Models simplify huge complexity of the world
into [perception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_cortex)
and [reasoning patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_process_theory#System_2_in_humans).

This idea is similar to the statistical machine learning approach i.e. modern deep learning
where the [Learning Algorithm is compressing the world into hierarchies of abstractions](https://www.skynettoday.com/editorials/nooscope#the-learning-algorithm-compressing-the-world-into-a-statistical-model)

Shared Mental Models distill knowledge into the collective wisdom according to [DIKW pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_pyramid#Computational_representation) (which itself is a model too).

People have tried to label them to build taxonomies of most common models
in order to create reasoning frameworks and to put them in toolboxes.

And so there're [plenty of them online](https://www.google.com/search?q=mental+models)

#### Gradient ascent along steep learning curve
> You learn the most when you feel like you're the most stupid person in the room

> To attain knowledge, add things everyday. To attain wisdom, remove things everyday  
> -- Lao Zi

> Warren and I are very good at destroying our own best-loved ideas. Any year that you don't destroy one of your best-loved ideas is probably a wasted year. Charlie likes the analogy of looking at one's ideas and approaches as "tools." When a better tool (idea or approach) comes along, what could be better than to swap it for your old, less useful tool? 'Warren and I routinely do this, but most people, as Galbraith says, forever cling to their old, less useful tools.
> -- Poor Charlie's Almanack

Iterate and refine models to sharp your [decision making skills](https://fs.blog/smart-decisions/) 

[Knowledge asymmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_asymmetry) yelds Power.

#### Multidisciplinary skills
> And the models have to come from multiple disciplines—because all the wisdom of the world is not to be found in one little academic department. That’s why poetry professors, by and large, are so unwise in a worldly sense. They don’t have enough models in their heads. So you’ve got to have models across a fair array of disciplines
> -- Charlie Munger / [A Lesson on Elementary Worldly Wisdom](https://fs.blog/great-talks/a-lesson-on-worldly-wisdom/)

> To the man with only a hammer, every problem looks like a nail

####  Reasoning
> In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. But, in practice, there is  
> -- Jan L.A. van de Snepscheut

> Kaizen - continuous incremental improvements

> The Art of Saying No (Sivers, Waitzkin)

Build hierarhical decision policy function: Values -> Stragegy -> Tactics -> Routine

#### Routine

> Nulla dies sine linea

> Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years.  
> ― Bill Gates

> True greatness consists of being great in little things. 
> -- Charles Simmons

> How you do anything is how you do everything
> -- T. Harv Eker / Secrets of the Millionaire Mind book

##### Morning ritual
> Finish your day with MIQ (most important question, ask and release, let go, relax) then brainstorm on morning wake up

### Pointers of Truth

> The wisdom of the wise, and the experience of ages, may be preserved by quotations  
> ― Isaac Disraeli

> It is a good thing for an uneducated man to read books of quotations  
> ― Sir Winston Churchill

> The greatest thing in this world is not so much where we are, but in what direction we are moving.  
> ― Oliver Wendell Holmes



> Я всю жизнь выписывал пословицы, которые мне нравились своей глубиной и точностью. Причем, не просто выписывал, а искал и находил решение трудных проблем. Когда появлялись дети, и я им вместо пустых назиданий давал эти пословицы.
Очень часто сила, свет этих народных указаний выручала меня, подбадривала, наставляла, утешала.  
> ― Александр Солженицын

Comming soon ..


### Limitations of language
> When the sage points at the moon, the fool looks at the finger
>> Truth has nothing to do with language. Truth is like Moon in the sky and language is like the finger that points to the moon. A finger can point out where the moon is, but the finger is not the truth. You can see the moon without help of any fingers, can you?

> -- Chan Buddhist scripture [Platform Sutra](https://www.quora.com/Does-the-saying-When-the-sage-points-at-the-moon-the-fool-looks-at-the-finger-really-have-Chinese-origins)
